<p>Across her near twenty-year career, Taylor Swift has become a marvel in the music industry. Known for her compelling songwriting and limitless genre choices, Swift has amassed over 100 million listeners on Spotify. She is the only artist to win Album of the Year at the GRAMMYs four times. This timeline showcases all of Swift's studio albums across the years, with release dates. This list includes any re-recordings, or (Taylor's Version) albums. Her Era's Tour is the highest grossing tour of all time, amassing $2 billion in revenue. She remains one of the most compelling figures in pop culture and her albums are very representative of that. Swift is set to release her "End of an Era" docuseries this December on Disney+. Let's revisit every Taylor Swift era.</p>
